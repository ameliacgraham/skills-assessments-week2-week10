Linked Lists
1. Nodes:
    "Apple"
    "Berry"
    "Cherry"

    Data:
    String "Apple"
    String "Berry"
    String "Cherry"

    Head:
    "Apple"

    Tail:
    "Cherry"
2. Doubly-linked lists have next and a prev node. Linked lists only know who is their childen (next).
3. It is faster because we don't need to go through the whole linked list to find which node is the end.
    We can just reassign the tail to point to the new node.
